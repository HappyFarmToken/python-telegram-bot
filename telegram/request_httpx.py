    """Implementation of ``PtbRequestBase`` abstraction class using ``httpx`` async HTTP client.

    Args:
        con_pool_size (int): Number of connections to keep in the connection pool. (default: 1)
        proxy_url (str): The URL to the proxy server. For example: `http://127.0.0.1:3128`.
        connect_timeout (float): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a
            connection attempt to a server to succeed. `None` will set an infinite timeout for
            connection attempts. (default: 5.0)
        read_timeout (float): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a response from
            Telegram's server. `None` will set an infinite timeout. This value is usually
            overridden by the various ``telegram.Bot`` methods. (default: 5.0)
        write_timeout (float): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a write
            operation to complete (in terms of a network socket; i.e. POSTing a request or
            uploading a file). `None` will set an infinite timeout. This value is usually
             overridden by the various ``telegram.Bot`` methods. (default: 5.0)
        pool_timeout (float): Timeout waiting for a connection object to become available and
            returned from the connection pool. `None` will set an infinite timeout. (default: 1.0)
